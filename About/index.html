<p>My name is Leonardo Ramallo and I'm a Cuban-American 3D generalist and game developer from Miami Florida.</p>
<p>I graduated from Florida International University (FIU) in 2017 with two Bachelor's degrees: a Bachelor's of Business Administration (B.B.A), and a Bachelor's of Science (B.Sc.) in general Biology.</p>
<p>I have 5 years of experience as a 3D generalist mainly self taught, working on personal projects and organized game jams. I've participated in 9 game jams since 2019, mostly using Unity and C#. </p>
<p>I have experience with hard surface modeling, organic sculpting (including human faces), texture painting, procedural texturing, rigging and animating humanoid characters, and preparing assets in various game engines.</p>
<h1>Software Proficiency</h1>
<ul>
<li>5 years of experience using Blender</li>
<li>3 years of experience with Unity 3D, working on personal projects and many game jams</li>
<li>2 years of experience with Substance Painter and Designer</li>
<li>2 years of experience sculpting in ZBrush</li>
<li>some experience working with UE4, and Amazon Lumberyard mostly importing and preparing assets</li>
</ul>
<h1>Business? Biology? Why Game Development?</h1>
<p><strong>TL;DR After undergrad, I did a lot of thinking while preparing for graduate school and realized what I enjoyed most about research was the creative aspect. I picked up programming and 3D art as a hobby during this time to fulfill a childhood dream of developing my own video game and quickly fell in love with it. almost 5 years later, I'm fully committed to a career change and working full time in game development.</strong></p>
<p>Game development is something I've always wanted to do, but it always seemed totally out of reach. I think this is because I never got the opportunity to meet anyone who worked in the industry while growing up in Miami. I was always surrounded by doctors and traffic ticket attorneys. </p>
<p>I went to college with the goal of going to medical school and becoming a doctor like my parents were in Cuba. I enrolled in FIU as a business major while doing pre-med coursework but after a few semesters, I found the business classes a lot less engaging than the pre-med ones, so I decided to just go for a full biology degree in addition to the business degree. I stuck with both programs till the end and in 4 years I graduated with 2 unrelated degrees.</p>
<p>Before graduation, I got the opportunity to shadow a doctor which quickly made me realize that ~~medical doctor~~ is quite literally the worst possible career choice I could make. The patients, the hospitals, the insurance companies, the bodily fluids, none of it appealed to me. I fell off my bike once and passed out not from any resulting injuries, but from reading the WebMD page for symptoms of internal bleeding. I should've realized earlier that I would've made a terrible doctor.</p>
<p>Post graduation, while studying for the GRE and working in clinical research doing administrative work and billing, I picked up programming as a hobby. I went from simple forms in Excel using VBA to developing a very useful (but janky) clinical trial management system using C# with WPF/XAML and MySQL. The success of this project was a massive boost to my confidence and helped me finally dive into game development.</p>
<p>I downloaded Blender and immediately fell in love with 3D art. I used to draw a lot when I was a child until it was hammered out of me by my classmates, but modeling in Blender reminded me a lot of what it felt like to be fully focused on creating something. It was as if I reactivated some dormant muscle memory from when I was a kid, and I immediately realized what I wanted to do with my life. What I loved about research, what I wanted to go to grad school for, was to have the freedom to create. After that realization I spent a lot more of my time learning everything about 3D art and game development. </p></span></article>
