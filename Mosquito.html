<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<p>This is one of my older projects which I started some time around late 2018. Over the years, I've gone back to redo and update this model as I improved my skills and knowledge of 3D art (I stopped working on it early 2020)</p>
<p>I chose a mosquito because I studied biology in my undergrad and acquired an interest in parasitology. The first thing I ever 3D modeled was actually Ixodes holocyclus, a tick.</p>
<h3><strong>Software used</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Blender</li>
<li>Substance Painter</li>
<li>Substance Designer</li>
<li>Gimp</li>
</ul>
<h3>Process</h3>
<p>To create this model I blocked out the basic shapes of the mosquito, separated by head, thorax, and abdomen. I then modeled some of the more important morphological features onto the blockout shapes to ensure that they have accurate positioning and proportions. I used a lot of reference images which were not particularly easy to find.  </p>
<p>I wanted my model to be as morphologically accurate as possible and I found that it was very difficult to make out the shapes and structures of the mosquito through regular images, so I opted to use scanning electron microscopy images. The problem with these types of images is that there aren't that many of them available online, even for such a medically important species like Aedes aegpyti. The few I found were limited to small regions of the body, or of a different species or sex which was an issue due to notable sexual dimorphism of mosquitoes.  </p>
<p>I managed to find some that I could use and was able to capture a good amount of detail for the head and thorax. I used the SEM images, close up photographs, and diagrams from various scientific journals and articles to create a pretty accurate model after sculpting in Blender.<br/>
When the sculpt was finished, I manually retopologized the model in Blender and created the UV map</p>

<p>I used substance designer to create the textures for the eye, and experimented with creating some sort of procedural scales material for the whole body but opted for a simpler design and left out the scales entirely. If I were to redo the model I would certainly include scales but as alpha textures on planes. I painted the rest of the textures in substance painter and created hair cards in Blender. For the thorax, I used what I believe is called the shells tecnhique to simulate a volume of hair. I used a series of duplicate geometry from the thorax, each offset a fixed distance from the body of the mosquito and with a hair alpha texture.</p>
<p>With the basic modeling and texturing done, I did a little more work to make it more interesting. I modeled an engorged version of the abdomen as a shape key so I could smoothly interpolate between the two states. I then created a procedural material using blender nodes to try and simulate what it would look like as it fills with blood.</p>
