<p>This model of an Aedes aegypti mosquito is major landmark on my journey into 3D graphics. I majored in biology during my undergraduate studies at Florida International University, and parasitology was a field that captured my imagination. During my final year, I studied ticks and mosquitoes extensively because I found them fascinating. I figured if I went for a career in academia, it would be focused on parasitology. 
After I graduated, and began playing around with blender as a hobby, I decided that I would at least try to make a realistic, morphologically accurate model of an Aedes aegypti mosquito. That was my goal, and so throughout my years of practice in 3D, I created many mosquitoes of varying quality as I improved my modeling and learned new techniques. This current model is what I considered to be the realization of my original goal in 3D graphics.</p>
<p>This model was finished in early 2020 and was made using Blender and Substance Painter. I used a lot of reference images and measurements from scientific journals to get the proportions as accurate as possible. The main issue in terms of accuracy is the size of the head which is disproportionately large. This is because I was developing a prototype mosquito video game in Unity, and I found that the size of the head made it look awkward from the players perspective, so I enlarged it a bit.</p>
<p>I began with a high poly sculpt of the 3 body segments: head, thorax, and abdomen. I then manually retopologized the sculpt with the goal of precisely modeling all of the important topological features. The topology isn't very efficient for a game, but this was intended to be detailed enough to be used as a teaching tool, to be able to point out and highlight specific parts of mosquito morphology. I then created a UV map and painted the model in substance painter. The material for the eyes was made in substance designer and the blood material for the abdomen I made using Blender's shader nodes. I set up shape keys for the abdomen so I could fill and drain the blood from it. This works very well in tandem with the abdomen shader.</p></span></article>
